    GLEAM (Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model)
    is a set of algorithms that separately estimate the different components of
    evapotranspiration. For more information, please consult https://www.gleam.eu/.
    GLEAM v4 is the newest version of this algorithm, combining efforts on hybrid modelling,
    improved interception and groundwater-sourced evaporation combined, all combined with a
    Penman equation for estimation of potential evaporation.
