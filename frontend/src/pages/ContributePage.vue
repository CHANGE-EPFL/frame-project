        You can use the <router-link to="/cli">CLI tool</router-link> to create,
        validate, and add your own models' and components' metadata to this
        library. You can also manually file a Pull Request on the
        <a href="https://github.com/CHANGE-EPFL/frame-project"
          >GitHub repository</a
        >
        of the FRAME project. In both cases, your submission will be reviewed by
        the project's maintainers.
